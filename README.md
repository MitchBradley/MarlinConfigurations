# MarlinConfigurations
Marlin configuration files for some 3D printers I own or manage

Each printer has its own branch

Ender3_BIQU is a Creality Ender with these mods:
  Melzi mainboard replaced by a BIQU Base V1.0,
  because the Melzi's extruder driver chip died.

  Ender display replaced by a ReprapDiscountSmartController
  (2004 text display) - because the Ender display
  has no SD card slot - it is on the Melzi board,
  and the BIQU Base V1.0 has no SD, so we needed
  a display with an SD card slot.

  This printer is owned by Kevin McDonald
